# Restaurant Ordering System 🍴☕

This is a simple console-based restaurant ordering system written in Python. The program allows customers to interact with a virtual waiter to place their orders, check prices, and calculate their total bill. It's a fun project to simulate real-world restaurant interactions.


## How to Use
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to interact with the virtual waiter:
   - Greet the waiter With hello in reply.
   - Browse the menu and place your orders.
   - Confirm your order and specify quantities.
   - Check your total bill.
3. Exit the system by declining further orders.

## Example Interaction
